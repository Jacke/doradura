# Documentation Rules

- All project documentation files must reside under the `docs/` directory in the repository root.
- Whenever a new documentation file is added or an existing one is renamed, it must be registered in the root `README.md` under the "📚 Documentation" section with a relative link (e.g., `docs/<file>.md`).
- References within documentation should use relative links pointing to `docs/` paths (e.g., `docs/LOCAL_BOT_API_SETUP.md`).
- The root `README.md` should remain the single entry point; do not keep standalone `.md` files in the repository root other than `README.md`.
